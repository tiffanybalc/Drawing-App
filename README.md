# Drawing-App
This app was created for a computer science class, with the objective of creating a smooth drawing app.
For my creative portion: I added the ability to save your drawing to the camera roll.
I also added several items which add to the overall function of the app. I added an eraser, redo button, and the ability to change the look of a path to a "square path," or "thickening line" path which increases in radius as you draw. Additionally, you can add a custom color with the "?" color button by inputing RGB values in the three textfields.
